# Product Recommendation System  
**Deep Personalized Recommendations using BERT, LSTM, Attention, and Cosine Similarity**

This project presents a hybrid recommendation engine that combines natural language understanding and sequential behavior modeling to generate highly personalized Top-100 product recommendations for each user.

---

## Overview

The system integrates multiple deep learning techniques to model both what users do and what products mean:

- **BERT** encodes the semantic meaning of product descriptions, user queries, or reviews.
- **LSTM** models the temporal dynamics of user interactions.
- **Attention Mechanism** highlights the most relevant past behaviors for recommendation.
- **Cosine Similarity** ranks products based on proximity to the userâ€™s preference embedding.

By unifying these components, the model captures deep contextual signals in both user behavior and product content.

## Architecture Highlights

- **BERT Embeddings**: Pre-trained Transformer-based embeddings for rich, contextual understanding of text (e.g., product metadata or reviews).
- **LSTM Layer**: Sequential modeling of user interaction history to learn evolving preferences.
- **Attention Layer**: Learns to emphasize important interactions within a session or history.
- **Cosine Similarity Ranking**: Efficient nearest-neighbor search to retrieve the Top-100 most relevant products for each user.
